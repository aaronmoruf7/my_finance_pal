# My Finance Pal

**Accurate personal finance insights that factor in reimbursements and group expenses.**

[Live App →]('will be live soon')

## Why This Exists

Most personal finance tools **overstate expenses and income** especially for college students and roommates—because they don't account for **group spending** and **peer reimbursements**.

For example:  
If you paid for groceries for your house and your friends reimbursed you later, your dashboard still shows the **full grocery bill as your own spend** and the **repayment as extra income**.  
That’s misleading.

**My Finance Pal** solves this by:
- Letting you **tag group expenses**
- Automatically detecting and reconciling **reimbursements**
- Giving you an **accurate picture of actual spending, income, and net flow**
